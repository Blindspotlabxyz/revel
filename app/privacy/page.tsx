              Revel (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;) is operated by BlindspotLab. This
              policy explains what we collect when you use {siteConfig.url},
              Mission Control, Partner API, MCP endpoints, OKX.AI marketplace
              integrations, and optional export connections (Linear, Notion,
              GitHub). We do not sell your personal data. We design exports so
              your reports are not written into a shared BlindspotLab workspace
              that other customers can browse.

              We use collected data to run product audits, store your analysis

              process marketplace payments, send transactional emails (account
              welcome, password reset, partner approval), run optional exports
              you request into <em>your</em> connected tools, and improve Revel.
              Public website content you submit for analysis is sent to our AI
